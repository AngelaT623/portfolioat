							The app is called A-lil-Bit-Salty. It is a picture based food app
							for people with a unique TASTE of humor. The app allows users to
							submit comments under not-so-attractive foods. Users can select
							specific pictures they want to comment under. The kicker is, users
							can update, or even delete anyone's comments. It is a community of
							satire commenting on disgusting images of "delicious" meals. In
							the future, we would like to add a feature that allows user's
							contents as well as user authentication, a feature that would only
							allow a specific user to edit, or delete their own comment.
